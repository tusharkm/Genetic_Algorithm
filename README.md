# Genetic Algorithm
Problem Statement:
-------------------
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution. The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm randomly selects individuals from the current population and uses them as parents to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population "evolves" toward an optimal solution.


Objective:
-------------------
1. To develop a GA to calculate any given number using a combination of a population i.e. number and arithmetic operations. 
2. This number and arithmetic operations are computed using Crossover and Mutation from generation to generation till the desired value is obtained.
3. The process is computed in a distributed system using Hadoop MapReduce jobs
